# An extreme value approach to CoVaR estimation

This is the repository to reproduce numerical results in the paper "Tail risk in the tail: Estimating high quantiles when a related variable is extreme".

## Overview

We provide the code and data to reproduce the numerical results in Sections 3-4 of the paper.
